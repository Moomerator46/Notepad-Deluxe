## What is Notepad Deluxe?
Notepad Deluxe is made by [Moomerator46](https://www.github.com/Moomerator46/) and made using the **Notepad Framework**.
Notepad Deluxe is a version of [Notepad Lite](https://www.github.com/Mancol001/Notepad-Lite-Official) by [Mancol001](https://www.github.com/Mancol001/).
Notepad Deluxe uses the **Tkinter** module in [Python](https://www.python.org/).

## What is the Notepad Framework?
The Notepad Framework is an unreleased module for Python that will let developers add their own projects to the Notepad Tkinter family.
To use it you will need to go to my GitHub and find the Notepad Framework repository and download the "**notepad.py**" folder.
Next, you will need to put it in the directory of your Python project.
To use it you can do:
```py
import notepad.py
```
## How do you install Notepad Deluxe?
You will need to download Python 3.7+ at https://www.python.org/

For Windows:
- Open Command Prompt
- Locate the directory of your project using `C:\Users\you>cd directory_path_here`
- Run `python main.py`
- It should be running now!
